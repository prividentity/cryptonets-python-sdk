CryptoNets SDK Usage Guide
==========================

API_KEY and SERVER_URL initialization parameters
------------------------------------------------

To access the factor server, you need to configure the server URL and API key.
These values should be stored in environment variables for secure and streamlined access.

Set the environment variables with the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    export PI_SERVER_URL = "SERVER_URL"
    export PI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"


Also, they can be passed directly to the FaceFactor constructor as we will show in the next section.

Create and the Face Factor Object
---------------------------------

You need to create an instance of the FaceFactor class in order to start using the SDK's FaceFactor object.

You can rely on environment variables to set the server URL and API key:

.. code-block:: py

    # Import the FaceFactor class from the CryptoNets SDK
    from cryptonets_python_sdk.factor import FaceFactor

    # Create an instance of the FaceFactor class using the environment variables
    face_factor = FaceFactor()


Or set the server URL and API key directly:

.. code-block:: py

    # Import the FaceFactor class from the CryptoNets SDK
    from cryptonets_python_sdk.factor import FaceFactor

    # Define the server URL and API key
    server_url = "https://sample.url.domain"  # Replace with your server URL
    api_key = "your-api-key"  # Replace with your API key

    # Initialize the FaceFactor instance with the server URL and API key
    face_factor = FaceFactor(server_url=server_url, api_key=api_key)


With this setup, you're ready to use the CryptoNetsâ„¢ SDK to generate and verify private IDs.


1) is_valid(): Validating Facial Biometrics
-------------------------------------------

The ``is_valid`` method checks an image for the presence of a valid facial biometric that meets specified restrictions.
This function processes the image, validates the facial biometric, and returns a facial validation result or relevant error codes.

This method is ideal for live capture scenarios, as it can guide users to make necessary adjustments (e.g., "remove eyeglasses," "remove mask," "look at camera") to ensure a valid facial image is captured.

Key Features of ``is_valid``:

* Runs on-device, responding within 50ms without requiring a server call
* Supports head tilt from -22.5 to 22.5 degrees (left to right)
* Allows uncontrolled poses (though not full profile)
* Minimum recommended face size is 224 x 224 pixels for optimal accuracy
* For best results, use an unprocessed image with as much padding around the face as possible, compliant with ISO 19794-5/INCITS 385-2004 (S2019) standards.

.. image:: images/isvalid_example.png
   :width: 600

Sample Usage:

.. code-block:: py

    # Import the FaceFactor class from the CryptoNets SDK
    from cryptonets_python_sdk.factor import FaceFactor

    # Initialize FaceFactor with the server URL and API key
    face_factor = FaceFactor(server_url=SERVER_URL, api_key=API_KEY)

    # Validate the image
    is_valid_result = face_factor.is_valid(image_path="path_to_the_image")  # Replace with the actual image path

    # Accessing results
    error_code = is_valid_result.error        # Error code, if any
    message = is_valid_result.message         # Operation message
    face_objects = is_valid_result.face_objects  # List of detected Face objects


Example Output:

.. image:: images/johny.jpg
   :width: 400
.. code-block:: py

    # Loop through detected faces
    for index, face in enumerate(is_valid_handle.face_objects):
        print(f"Face #:{index + 1}")
        print(f"Return Code: {face.return_code}")
        print(f"Message: {face.message}")
        print(f"BBox Top Left: {face.bounding_box.top_left_coordinate}")
        print(f"BBox Bottom Right: {face.bounding_box.bottom_right_coordinate}\n")


Output:

.. code-block:: py

Additional configurations can be found in the :ref:`is_valid advanced instructions <isvalid_advanced>` section.

2) estimate_age(): Determining User Age
---------------------------------------

The ``estimate_age`` method analyzes a frontal facial image to determine if a valid biometric match is present
based on specified restrictions, and it returns an estimated age (range: 0-100) along with the bounding box or relevant error codes.

This method is particularly useful for live capture applications where continuous age estimation is required.

Key Features of ``estimate_age``:

* Runs on-device with ~50ms response time, eliminating the need for server calls
* Supports head tilt between -22.5 to 22.5 degrees (left to right)
* Allows uncontrolled poses (excluding full profiles)
* Recommended minimum face size is 224 x 224 pixels for optimal accuracy
* For best results, provide the original image without cropping. If a cropped image is used, include as much padding around the head as possible, following standards like ISO 19794-5/INCITS 385-2004 (S2019).

.. image:: images/age_example.png
   :width: 600

5) antispoof_check(): Spoof Detection in Facial Recognition
-----------------------------------------------------------

The ``antispoof_check`` method is designed to enhance the security of facial recognition systems by distinguishing authentic live captures from potential spoof attempts.
By analyzing specific characteristics within the image, this method helps prevent fraudulent access.

* Accepts a single frontal face image.
* Analyzes the image for signs of spoofing, such as texture irregularities or digital alterations.
* Returns an ``AntispoofCheckResult`` object, which includes the status, message, and a boolean indicating if spoofing was detected.
* **On-device processing**: The check runs locally, with a typical response time of 100ms, requiring no server communication.
* **Image Requirements**:igh-resolution images (224 x 224 pixels minimum) are recommended. Lower resolutions are supported, though detection accuracy may vary.
* **Head Pose**:Effective for frontal views, within a range of -15 to +15 degrees for both yaw and pitch.
* **Best Practices**:se unprocessed images for optimal results. If cropping is needed, include sufficient background around the face.

The ``AntispoofCheckResult`` encapsulates the output of the antispoof check, with these attributes:

* **status**: Integer that indicates the status of the operation.
* **message**: A descriptive message about the operationâ€™s outcome.
* **is_antispoof**: Boolean that indicates whether a spoofing attempt was detected (``True`` if spoofing detected, ``False`` otherwise).

Sample Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   # Import the FaceFactor class from the CryptoNets SDK
    from cryptonets_python_sdk.factor import FaceFactor

    # Initialize FaceFactor with server URL and API key
    face_factor = FaceFactor(server_url=SERVER_ADDRESS, api_key=API_KEY)

    # Perform antispoof check
    antispoof_result = face_factor.antispoof_check(image_path="path_to_face_image")  # Replace with the actual image path

    # Accessing results
    print("Status: {}\nMessage: {}\nSpoof Detected: {}".format(
        antispoof_result.status, antispoof_result.message, antispoof_result.is_antispoof))


Sample Output:

.. code-block:: py

    Status: 0
    Message: 'No spoofing detected.'
    Spoof Detected: False

Refer to :ref:`return_codes <return_codes>` for a comprehensive list of possible result and status codes.

6) enroll(): Initialize Subjectâ€™s Face in the Identification System
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``enroll`` method is used to register a subjectâ€™s facial biometric in the identification system.
It accepts a frontal facial image, along with an API key and specified restrictions.
This method verifies if the image contains a valid facial biometric that meets the specified criteria.
If valid, it transforms the biometric data into homomorphic token ciphertexts, deletes the original plaintext biometric, and securely transmits the ciphertext to the backend.

Process Flow:

* If enrollment is successful and the user is new, the method returns 0 along with a new PUID and GUID.
* If the user is already enrolled, it returns 0 and the existing PUID and GUID.
* If the image is invalid, it returns -1 along with relevant error codes.

Key features of ``enroll``:

* The operation completes within 200ms, including server processing time.
* Supports head tilt from -22.5 to 22.5 degrees (left to right).
* Recommended for controlled poses with no eyeglasses or facemasks, facing forward for highest accuracy.
* Minimum recommended face size is 224 x 224 pixels.
* For best results, provide the original image without cropping. If cropped, ensure there is adequate padding around the head, ideally following ISO 19794-5/INCITS 385-2004 (S2019) standards.

Sample Usage:

.. code-block:: py

  Token:None

For additional configuration options and advanced settings, see the :ref:`enroll advanced instructions <enroll_advanced>` section.

7) predict(): 1:N Matching of a Probe Image to the Enrolled Gallery
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``predict`` method performs a 1:n match, comparing a single probe image containing one or more faces against a gallery of enrolled faces.
This method verifies if the probe image meets specified restrictions, transforms valid facial biometrics into homomorphic token ciphertexts, deletes the original plaintext data, and securely transmits the ciphertext to the backend.

Process Flow:

* If a match is found with an enrolled face, the method returns 0 along with the matched PUID and GUID.
* If no valid enrolled face is found, it returns -1 with appropriate error codes.

Key Features of ``predict``:
